  _title: The Trap
  _shortDescription: Its a mine
  _fullDescription: "It doesn't take 'em out right away, but it sets up a fine trap
    for any monster that dares to cross its path. Let a beast step on it, and it's
    curtains for them. Just a heads up, it needs a sec to dig in before it's ready.
    Use it with the target item, and you're not just laying down one, but three traps
    at once \u2014 pretty much shuts the door on any critters trying to get through."
