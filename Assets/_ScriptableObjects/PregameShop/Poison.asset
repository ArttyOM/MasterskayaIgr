  _title: The Stinker
  _shortDescription: Applies poison
  _fullDescription: Quite the nasty but effective spell, this one. Ain't just hurtin'
    but also lays a poison on all them critters around. They keep losin' health bit
    by bit. Ain't much, but it sticks for good. Pair it up with the target item,
    and you conjure up a stinkin' cloud (for a while) that'll poison any varmint
    dumb enough to wander into it.
