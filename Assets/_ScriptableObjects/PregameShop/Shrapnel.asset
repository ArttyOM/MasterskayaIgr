  _fullDescription: "Time to show those fiends what heavenly wrath looks like. Seriously,
    it's like a strike from the sky \u2014 no, even 4 blasts raining down, covering
    a big ol' chunk of the map. Toss it together with the target item, and you'll
    get not just double, but triple the aerial assaults. Just scorched earth waiting
    for all those who rose from beneath it."
